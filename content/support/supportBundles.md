CloudBees engineers are eager to help you with your Jenkins issues.   To better assist you, knowledge about your environment is needed.  The Support Bundle helps CloudBees engineers diagnose customer issues in the CloudBees Jenkins environment.   First you will need the Support Core Plugin.  The plugin can be found at https://plugins.jenkins.io/support-core . As with any plugin installation or update, take a backup of your “JENKINS_HOME” directory first.

A presentation describing what a Support Bundle includes can be found at https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/devopsworldjenkinsworld2018a/7f/My%20friend%2C%20the%20support%20bundle%20-%20Arnaud%20He%CC%81ritier.pdf
