# Your Jenkins team

Jenkins is usually managed, configured and used by team members with different roles. Here is an example of different roles and responsibilities which can be adjusted to your organization:

| Role          | Responsabilities and Duties           |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Project Business Sponsor     | This is more of a strategic role, overseeing how Jenkins is useful in impacting the business.|
| Project/Program Manager      | This role is more tactical and oversees use cases.      |
| Technical Owner for Jenkins  | Administrator of Jenkins      |

Note that in smaller organizations, more than one role can be fulfilled by the same person.
