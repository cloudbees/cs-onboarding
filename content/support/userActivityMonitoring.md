This is not available for Jenkins LTS.  The User Activity Monitoring plugin helps you understand licensing and entitlement. It provides you with a summary of user activity, CSV exports of user access details, and JSON reports that can be exported to other applications.

This topic explains how to install the plugin, prepare your instance or instances for reporting, and generate reports.
