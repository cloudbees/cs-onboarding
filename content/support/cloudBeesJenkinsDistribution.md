Did you know that CloudBees offers a free, more support-ready out-of-the-box Jenkins?  [CloudBees Jenkins Distribution](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-jenkins-distribution/latest/distro-install-guide/) (CJD) is everything you know and love about Jenkins with added functionality from your experts at CloudBees. We call it “Jenkins tailored for you.” A highly dependable, secure Jenkins environment curated from the most recent supported Jenkins release.
