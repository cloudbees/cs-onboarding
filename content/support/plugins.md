Jenkinsâ€™ ever growing plugin ecosystem is the source of its extensibility, enabling it  to meet the specific needs of nearly any project. With a huge variety of plugins in the Jenkins and CloudBees universe to choose from, we are pleased to offer the [CloudBees Assurance Program](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/assurance-program/) (or CAP) for our CloudBees Jenkins Distribution users looking to simplify plugin management.  CAP specifies the set of plugins, plugin versions, and plugin dependencies that are either verified or trusted, depending on how much they have been tested. This provides greater stability and security for Jenkins environments. Not only are these plugins independently stable,but they are tested as a whole (in aggregate) to ensure compatibility with each other and the Jenkins instance.

You can find the CloudBees plugin by going to the [CloudBees documentation](https://docs.cloudbees.com/plugins) site and click on [Plugins](https://docs.cloudbees.com/plugins).  

The table below will help guide you 

|Tier    | Description                         | Icon     |
