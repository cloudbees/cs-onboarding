Before working with CloudBees support, we will need to make sure that backups of your system are in place.

The most important part of having a healthy Jenkins environment is to ensure that you have a valid and regular backup of your "Jenkins home" directory. Please follow our Backup and Restore Guide. We also recommend you take a point-in-time backup before making software changes to Jenkins, such as installing new plugins like the ones below, upgrading plugins, or upgrading Jenkins.  You can read how to configure these in the Backup and restore guide: https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/backup-restore/
