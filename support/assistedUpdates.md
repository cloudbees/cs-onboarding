Next time you are interested in updating Jenkins to the latest release, we recommend an “Assisted Update” for all our users to help guide them through their Jenkins updates to make the process easier and safer.

This process allows a CloudBees Development Support Engineer to review your instance and prepare a customized update plan which contains:

* A summarized list of known potential issues you may encounter during the update, based on your current version, target version, plugin versions, build agents, and what we have experienced with other clients during their previous updates
* Analysis of known issues your Jenkins instance(s) are encountering, or could encounter based on the data in the support bundles
* Best practice recommendations on how to test before doing the update in production
* Simple steps to follow when doing the production update
* Recommendations regarding backups, so that if any issues occur during the production update, we can easily recover from them
* A 30 minute consultation call to explain the update notes and give you a chance to ask any questions you may have regarding your update
